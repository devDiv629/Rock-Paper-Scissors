## Some More Fun
You cannot cheat with your friends in Rock Paper Scissors when you play it face-to-face. But in this virtual game, you can! You can activate cheats in this game. The cheats are hidden, you can access them when the game is paused. After pausing the game, first triple tap/click on the very bottom of the screen/window rapidly. Then triple tap/click on the very top of the screen/window of game. This will reveal the cheats! Now, activate any cheat and make your friends fool ;-)  

**Note:** I do not promote cheating in any way. In this game, cheats are added only for fun.
